# FizzBuzz

I took up this program because it does not require the users to know any specific domain. Even people who are new to OOPS can do this in a procedural language. In other words, the purpose is to just learn TDD. Rest is not of concern.

## How am I going to do it?
Different versions of TDD implementation of FizzBuzz. Each branch will have another version of the implementation with `master` branch not having any code. 

To simulate real behavior as closely as possible and to drive the message that even toy code can have "change requests", I have added the requirements in two parts.

## Requirements:
### Iteration 1:
The requirements for the program are as follows:
Print numbers from 1 to 100.
But for the multiples of 3, print `Fizz` instead and for multiples of 5, print `Buzz`. \
For multiples of both, print `FizzBuzz`.

### Iteration 2:
If the number contains a 3 (for example 23), print `Bizz`.
If the number contains a 5, print `Fuzz` (if it contains multiple 3s or 5s, just print one `Bizz` or `Fuzz`).
If the number contains more than one of these attributes, print every word (for example 33 prints `FizzBizz`, as 33 is both a multiple of 3 and contains the digit 3).

## Expected Output
TBD
